The data contained noise and has a significant amount of missing values, which made it challenging to apply modeling techniques out-of-the-box. We approach this challenge in three different ways: imputation, model selection, and variable selection. For each, we perform experiments to determine the optimal strategy or modeling technique by training models and evaluating their performance on the provided testing data. Throughout this project, we optimized for both model performance and model simplicity and arrived at the conclusion that a complex imputation combined with a simple hyperparameter-tuned Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is the best model.\nLink to Project"
