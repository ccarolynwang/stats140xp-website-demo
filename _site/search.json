    "text": "Predicting Alcholic Status Using Vitals\nIn this group project, we aimed to predict whether or not someone is alcoholic from various vital tests and attributes. The data contained noise and has a significant amount of missing values, which made it challenging to apply modeling techniques out-of-the-box. We approach this challenge in three different ways: imputation, model selection, and variable selection. For each, we perform experiments to determine the optimal strategy or modeling technique by training models and evaluating their performance on the provided testing data. Throughout this project, we optimized for both model performance and model simplicity and arrived at the conclusion that a complex imputation combined with a simple hyperparameter-tuned Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is the best model.\nLink to Project"

Using a publicly-available database of their choosing, students applied computational methods to conduct humanistic inquiry on their database. The resulting narrative is presented in an engaging, interactive website. This project explores the role of location and geography in shaping child education and opportunity across the United States and addresses the research questions 1. What role do local population numbers play in children’s educational opportunities in the U.S.? and 2. What patterns exist between income, education opportunity, and population?\nLink to Project"
